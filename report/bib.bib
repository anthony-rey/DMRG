	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.}

	abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a state-of-the-art numerical technique for a one dimensional quantum many-body system; but calculating accurate results for a system with Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) from the conventional DMRG has been a challenging job from the inception of DMRG. The recent development of the Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm gives a new approach to find accurate results for the one dimensional PBC system. The most efficient implementation of the MPS algorithm can scale as O($p \times m^3$), where $p$ can vary from 4 to $m^2$. In this paper, we propose a new DMRG algorithm, which is very similar to the conventional DMRG and gives comparable accuracy to that of MPS. The computation effort of the new algorithm goes as O($m^3$) and the conventional DMRG code can be easily modified for the new algorithm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Received:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 2 August 2016, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Accepted:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 12 October 2016; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edited by:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; K.

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = −Tr ρAlogρA corresponding to the reduced density matrix ρA of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length ξ is large but finite, we show that , where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.}

We introduce the spin fields which intertwine the two sectors and correspond to the irreducible representations of the Ramond algebra. We give the determinant formula for the Ramond algebra and the discrete list of possible unitary representations. We have previously noted that the Z2 even sector of the tricritical Ising model is a representation of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra. Here we complete the picture by showing that the Z2 odd sector forms a representation of the Ramond algebra. This system is the first experimentally realizable supersymmetric field theory.}

I the phase coexistence regions the massive excitations are kink states. On the temperature-driven two-phase coexistence line, they form bound states, which we analyze for periodic as well as for twisted boundary conditions. We find a new asymmetric two-phase region driven by the subleading magnetic field. There are some indications of massless states along the crossover line to the Ising model. The effects of off-critical integrability on the spectra are also observed and discussed.}
