\section{Conclusion}

	Throughout this project, several aspect of computational quantum physics have been learned. Firstly, the implementation of DMRG enabled to understand deeper the idea underlying the MPS formalism as well as the ground state search using DMRG. Secondly, the extraction of excitation energies in a very efficient way for critical system. Moreover, controlling the convergence to the ground state via the application of some parity operator or the pinning of the edge spins. Finally, the construction of the MPO for Hamiltonian and how to use the DMRG with periodic boundary conditions in an computationally inefficient way but that does not require any change in the code except the calculation of the corresponding MPO Hamiltonian.
